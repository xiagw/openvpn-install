**⚠️ Unless you are sure you find a bug with the script, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install/discussions) instead of an issue!**

**Checklist**

- [ ] I read the [README](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install/blob/master/README.md)
- [ ] I read the [FAQ](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install/blob/master/FAQ.md)
- [ ] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install/issues?q=is%3Aissue+)
- [ ] I searched the [discussion](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install/discussions)
- [ ] My issue is about the script, and not OpenVPN itself

<!---
